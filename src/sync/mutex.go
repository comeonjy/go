// starvation:释放锁如果有阻塞等待的协程，则会释放信号量唤醒一个阻塞的协程；如果此时锁被自旋协程获取，被唤醒的协程将再次进入阻塞等待，若阻塞时间超过1ms则进入饥饿模式；饥饿模式将不再自旋，阻塞协程唤醒后直接获取到锁

	// Mutex fairness.
	//
	// Mutex can be in 2 modes of operations: normal and starvation.
	// In normal mode waiters are queued in FIFO order, but a woken up waiter
	// does not own the mutex and competes with new arriving goroutines over
	// the ownership. New arriving goroutines have an advantage -- they are
	// already running on CPU and there can be lots of them, so a woken up
	// waiter has good chances of losing. In such case it is queued at front
	// of the wait queue. If a waiter fails to acquire the mutex for more than 1ms,
	// it switches mutex to the starvation mode.
	//
	// In starvation mode ownership of the mutex is directly handed off from
	// the unlocking goroutine to the waiter at the front of the queue.
	// New arriving goroutines don't try to acquire the mutex even if it appears
	// to be unlocked, and don't try to spin. Instead they queue themselves at
	// the tail of the wait queue.
	//
	// If a waiter receives ownership of the mutex and sees that either
	// (1) it is the last waiter in the queue, or (2) it waited for less than 1 ms,
	// it switches mutex back to normal operation mode.
	//
	// Normal mode has considerably better performance as a goroutine can acquire
	// a mutex several times in a row even if there are blocked waiters.
	// Starvation mode is important to prevent pathological cases of tail latency.
